                <p>A trip to Alaska is simply incomplete without experiencing Denali National Park. At its core rises North America's tallest mountain, the beautiful 20,310-foot Denali. 
                    Countless other peaks of the greater Alaska Range arch across the park lands. This forms a natural barrier between the huge glaciers and silty rivers to the south, 
                    and the rolling hills and drier taiga of the north.
                    There is only one road into the Denali National Park. It runs 92 miles through the park's north country, but only the first 14 miles are accessible by private vehicle.
                    After the Savage River Bridge, only shuttles and tour bus services (and the occasional stalwart cyclist) traverse the Park Road. Destinations in the park include the 
                    Stony Hill Overlook, Polychrome Pass, Eielson Visitor Center, Wonder Lake, and historic Kantishna townsite.
                    The park's six million acres encompass a complete sub-arctic ecosystem that's home to large mammals like grizzly bears, wolves, Dall sheep, caribou, and moose. In fact, 
                    it was the desire to protect area wildlife, specifically Dall sheep, that led to the creation of what was then called Mount McKinley National Park in 1917.
                    Keep reading for expert Denali National Park advice on where to stay, things to do, and how to get around.
                    Of the many things to do in the Denali area, the very best way to experience the park is on a narrated bus tour. These range from a five-hour natural history tour to 
                    mile 25 on the Park Road, to an expansive full-day tour that goes all the way to Kantishna.
                    The greater Denali Park area offers a slew of activities, too. Flightsee by winged plane or helicopter, take a guided naturalist hike, ATV, or zipline-there's something 
                    for every traveler. Please visit our Things to Do in Denali National Park page for more ideas Due to its location in the interior of the state and the time required to take in this expansive park, we recommend spending two or three nights in the Denali National 
                    Park area. Nearly all lodging options are located outside the park entrance. We recommend the Denali Bluffs Hotel, the Grande Denali Lodge, and the Denali Princess 
                    Wilderness Lodge. If you prefer a unique wilderness experience, a stay at a backcountry lodge inside the park is sure to fulfill all your expectations. A local favorite 
                    is the historic Kantishna Roadhouse, an all-inclusive backcountry property 90 miles within the park and accessible via guided bus tour.
                    Located along the Parks Highway, the entrance to Denali National Park is approximately 240 miles north of Anchorage and 125 miles south of Fairbanks. Denali National 
                    Park is accessible by car or via the Alaska Railroad from either Anchorage or Fairbanks. Another great option is the Park Connection Motorcoach, which offers daily 
                    summer service between the park and Seward, Whittier, Anchorage, and Talkeetna. See our Denali National Park Transportation page for a complete list of options.</p>
