                <p>No other region in Alaska compares to the Southwest in its utter diversity. In an area roughly the same size as California, there are volcanoes, temperate rainforests, 
                    major river drainages, highlands, lowlands, tundra, boreal forests, 10,000-foot peaks, glaciers, sprawling wetlands, and thousands of miles of coastlines. And that's 
                    not to mention wildlife, Alaskan Native cultures, and surprising human history.
                    To provide a little context, the Southwest region encompasses the Alaska Peninsula from the Cook Inlet to the state's west coast and the upper Yukon River drainage 
                    south to the Aleutian Islands. Within this rough boundary are Lake Clark National Park, Katmai National Park, and numerous wildlife refuges, sanctuaries, state parks, 
                    and national monuments
                    The Aleutians are perhaps Southwest Alaska's most notable natural feature. The chain of windswept islands stretches for 1,000 miles between the Pacific Ocean and 
                    Bearing Sea. They are buffeted by near-constant winds and battered by rolling seas. And as if that weren't enough, many of the islands are actually active volcanoes. 
                    Interestingly, the far Aleutian Island of Attu was the site of the only World War II battle fought in North America. It is, even by Alaska standards, a fantastically 
                    wild place
                    Southwest Alaska is home to only about a tenth of all Alaskans, a small population vastly outnumbered by wildlife. Wetlands and cliffside rookeries draw 230 different 
                    species of migratory birds in the summer. Abundant spawning grounds within pristine rivers and lakes feed the famous Bristol Bay fishery. Thousands of fur seals 
                    congregate on Pribilof Island in the summer, while the world's highest concentration of brown bears congregate at the famous Brooks Falls to feast on salmon.</p>
