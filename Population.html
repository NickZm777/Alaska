                <p>Alaska, constituent state of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 49th state on January 3, 1959. 
                    Alaska is bounded by the Beaufort Sea and the Arctic Ocean to the north; Canada’s Yukon territory and British Columbia province 
                    to the east; the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south; the Bering Strait and the Bering Sea to the west; and the Chukchi
                    Sea to the northwest. The capital is Juneau, which lies in the southeast, in the panhandle region. Upon attaining statehood, Alaska
                    increased the size of the United States by nearly one-fifth. The new area included vast stretches of unexplored land and untapped resources. 
                    Its settlement and exploitation have been hindered by its distance from the rest of the country and by geographic and climatic impediments 
                    to travel and communications; Alaska continues to be the country’s last frontier. About half of the state’s inhabitants live in the Greater 
                    Anchorage–Kenai Peninsula area. Alaska comprises eight distinct physiographic and environmental regions. Much of the mainland panhandle region, 
                    a narrow strip of land 25 to 50 miles (40 to 80 km) wide lying east and south of the St. Elias Mountains, is composed of the Boundary Ranges. 
                    There are several large ice fields there, and the peaks include Mount St. Elias (18,008 feet [5,489 metres]), from whose summit the Alaska-Yukon 
                    border shifts due north following the 141st meridian. The western extension of that mountain chain is the Chugach Range, a giant arc at the northernmost
                    edge of the Gulf of Alaska. Many of the range’s remote valleys and high ridges are still unexplored, and the relief and glaciation inhibit exploitation. 
                    The coast is characterized by frequent and intense oceanic storm systems that have produced dense rain forests on the coastal mountain flanks. The region 
                    of the south coastal archipelago and the Gulf of Alaska islands includes the Alexander Archipelago in the panhandle region, with 1,100 islands, as well as 
                    Kodiak Island, just southeast of the Alaska Peninsula, and its satellites south of Cook Inlet. Those islands are lower, less rugged, and less glaciated. 
                    All receive heavy rain and are affected by waters warmed by both the Kuroshio and Alaska currents. Alaska is larger than Texas, California and Montana combined. 
                    Alaska’s 586,412 square miles measure 2,400 miles east to west and 1,420 miles north to south. Alaska has 19 mountain peaks higher than 14,000 feet. Seventeen 
                    of the 20 highest peaks in the United States are in Alaska. Mt. McKinley is the highest peak in North America at 20,320 feet high. Yukon’s Mt. Logan is the 
                    highest in Canada at 19,551 feet. Alaska has 6,640 miles of coastline. Include all its islands and there are more than 33,900 miles of shoreline, which is 
                    double the amount in the Lower 48. Alaska has more than 70 volcanoes, with several erupting recently. Volcanic smoke is often visible to the west of the 
                    Kenai Peninsula. Valdez was near the epicenter of North America’s strongest recorded earthquake with a force measuring 9.2 on the Richter Scale that struck 
                    on March 27, 1964. Alaska has about 100,000 glaciers. There are more active glaciers and ice fields in Alaska than the rest of the inhabited world. The 850 
                    square mile Malaspina Glacier in southeast Alaska is the state’s largest and is the largest piedmont glacier in North America, spanning 60 miles across. 
                    (A piedmont glacier is a steep valley glacier glacier which has spread out into bulb-like lobes from spilling into flat plains.) Exit Glacier, near Seward, 
                    is one of Alaska’s most visited glaciers. Alaska has more than 3,000 rivers and over 3 million lakes. The 1,000 square mile Lake Iliamna is the largest. 
                    The 1,980 mile long Yukon River, which originates near Atlin, British Columbia and flows through Yukon, is the third longest river in the U.S. The highest 
                    highway pass in Alaska is Atigun Pass at 4,800 feet on the Dalton Highway. Maclaren Summit, 4,086 feet on the Denali Highway (Cantwell-Paxson) is the 
                    second highest. Eagle Summit, 3,685 feet, on the way to Circle is ranked third.</p>
