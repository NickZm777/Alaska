                <p>Southcentral is home to half the population of Alaska. There's better connectivity and access, more towns and services. 
                    It's the only extensively drivable region in the state. The Alaska Railroad runs straight through, as do bus lines like 
                    the Park Connection Motorcoach. There is even an international airport. And yet, despite the infrastructure and concentration 
                    of human activity, in Alaska the wilds are never far off.
                    The region encompasses a diverse swath of land from the border of Denali National Park south to Kenai Fjords National Park,
                    and the Cook Inlet east to Canada. Except for the Arctic's permafrost, within this region you'll find every other type of 
                    Alaskan landscape. There are high alpine meadows and glaciated peaks, boreal forests and wetlands, as well as huge river deltas and craggy fjords.
                    Because of rich diversity coupled with its accessibility, this region is Alaska's playground. You can spend days hiking the 
                    trail systems in Chugach State Park near Anchorage. You can flightsee through the Alaska Range from Talkeetna and over glaciers 
                    in Girdwood. History is richly preserved at places like McCarthy and Kennecott in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. There are myriad 
                    rivers to float or fish as well, with the aqua-blue Kenai River among the most scenic.
                    That's all not to mention the water, of which there is plenty in Southcentral Alaska. The region encompasses all of Prince William 
                    Sound plus Kenai Fjords National Park and Kachemak Bay State Park on the Kenai Peninsula. These areas are accessed by Valdez or 
                    Whittier, Seward, and Homer respectively. Whether it's by fishing charter or day cruise, visiting waterways abundant in both 
                    wildlife and glaciers is a must for every traveler in Alaska.</p>
