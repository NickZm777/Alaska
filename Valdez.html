                <p>Valdez is located at 61°7′51″N 146°20′54″W. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 277.1 square miles (718 km2), of which, 
                    222.0 square miles (575 km2) is land and 55.1 square miles (143 km2) (19.88%) is water.
                    Valdez is located near the head of a deep fjord in the Prince William Sound in Alaska. It is surrounded by the Chugach Mountains, which are heavily glaciated. 
                    Valdez is the northernmost port in North America that is ice-free year-round. The northernmost point of the coastal Pacific temperate rain forest is in Valdez, 
                    on Blueberry Hill. Despite the presence of temperate rainforest, Valdez under the Köppen climate classification has a subarctic climate (Dfc): its winters, though 
                    much warmer than most climates of this type, are not sufficiently mild, as those of, say, Ketchikan or Kodiak are, to fit into the oceanic or subpolar oceanic climate 
                    category.
                    According to the Weather Channel and NOAA, Valdez is the snowiest city in the United States, with an average of almost 300 inches per year. There have been more 
                    than 100 inches of snow in five separate months (not all in the same year). The Valdez Marine Terminal is an oil port in Valdez, at the southern end of the Alaska 
                    Pipeline. The terminal was the point of departure for the Exxon Valdez just prior to the oil spill.
                    There are 14 active aboveground crude oil storage tanks at the terminal, and an average of three to five oil tankers depart from the terminal each week. Since the 
                    pipeline became operational in 1976, more than 15,000 tankers full of oil have left the terminal.
                    The terminal has 2 operational loading berths.Valdez is connected to the interior of Alaska by the Richardson Highway, and is a port of call in the Alaska Marine 
                    Highway ferry system. Just north of Valdez on the highway is Thompson Pass, which has spectacular waterfalls and glaciers next to the highway. Thompson Pass is also 
                    known for treacherous driving conditions during the winter.
                    The Valdez Airport, also known as Pioneer Field, is serviced by one airline, Ravn Alaska. Valdez hosted the World Extreme Skiing Championship (WESC) in the early 1990s. 
                    Valdez is a fishing port, both for commercial and sport fishing. Freight moves through Valdez bound for the interior of Alaska. Sightseeing of the marine life and glaciers, 
                    together with both deep-sea fishing, and heli skiing support a tourist industry in Valdez. The oil from the Trans-Alaska pipeline is loaded onto ships at the Valdez oil terminal.
                    Alyeska Pipeline Service Company is one of the biggest employers in town but it started to move several positions to its headquarters in Anchorage since the town council 
                    passed a resolution charging a tax to all the tankers coming into the port to be loaded with oil. This has had an impact in the population size and the economy.</p>
