                <p>Wasilla is a city in Matanuska-Susitna Borough, United States and the sixth-largest city in Alaska. It is located on the northern point of Cook Inlet in the Matanuska-Susitna 
                    Valley of the southcentral part of the state. The city's population was 7,831 at the 2010 census, up from 5,469 in 2000. Estimates in 2019 put the population at 10,838. 
                    Wasilla is the largest city in the borough and a part of the Anchorage metropolitan area, which had an estimated population of 399,148 in 2018.
                    Established at the intersection of the Alaska Railroad and Old Carle Wagon Road, the city prospered at the expense of the nearby mining town of Knik. Historically 
                    entrepreneurial, the economic base shifted in the 1970s from small-scale agriculture and recreation to support for workers employed in Anchorage or on Alaska's North 
                    Slope oilfields and related infrastructure. The George Parks Highway turned the town into a commuter suburb of Anchorage. Several state and federal agencies have 
                    offices in Wasilla, including the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and Divisions of Public Assistance, Social Services.
                    Wasilla gained international attention when Sarah Palin, who served as Mayor of Wasilla before her election as Governor of Alaska, was chosen by John McCain as his 
                    running mate for Vice President of the United States in the 2008 United States presidential election.
                    Wasilla is named after Chief Wasilla, a local Dena'ina chief. "Wasilla" is the anglicized spelling of the chief's Russian-given name, Васи́лий Vasilij, which corresponds 
                    to the English name Basil. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 12.4 square miles (32.2 km²). 11.7 square miles (30.4 km²) of it is land 
                    and 0.7 square miles (1.8 km²) of it (5.64%) is water Located near Wasilla Lake and Lake Lucille, Wasilla is one of two cities in the Matanuska Valley. 
                    e community surrounds Mi. 39–46 of the George Parks Highway, roughly 
                    43 mi (69 km) by highway northeast of Anchorage. Nearly one third of the people of Wasilla drive the 40-minute commute to work in Anchorage every day. Six miles to the 
                    southeast is Mount POW/MIA. Wasilla has a climate similar to that of Anchorage, but with slightly warmer daytime maxima and colder nighttime minima due to its inland 
                    location. Classified as subarctic climate (Dfc) by Köppen-Geiger climate classification. On average, over the course of the entire year, there are 30–31 days of sub-0 °F 
                    (−18 °C) lows, 37–38 days of 70 °F (21 °C)+ highs, and 1.4 days of 80 °F (27 °C)+ highs. The average annual precipitation is 17 inches (430 mm), with 52 inches (132 cm) 
                    of snowfall.</p>
