                    <p>Alaska, the largest state of the United States with a surface of more than 1.7 million square kilometers (650,000 square miles), largely deserves its 
                        reputation of a cold land, but it has also maritime and wet areas, which are not as cold as you might think. More to the south, the winter climate is 
                        less cold, while summer is still very cool, in fact, the average in July and August remains around 10 °C (50 °F).
                        In Cape Newenham, the temperature is around -8.5 °C (16.5 °F) in January and 10 °C (50 °F) in July. Precipitation amounts to 930 mm (36.5 inches) per 
                        year, with a minimum between February and April and a maximum between July and October. Snow totals 2 meters (6.5 feet) per year, and usually falls 
                        from October to May. In the central and western part of the Alaska Peninsula, typically the sea does not freeze in winter, but sometimes it can do it, 
                        at least on the north coast and during the coldest winters. Here is the sea temperature in Cold Bay (which is located on the south coast). The Aleutian 
                        Islands are even milder, but they still have tundra vegetation because of their cold maritime climate, which is similar to that of Iceland. So, the climate 
                        here is cold but not too much in winter, with averages around -2/0 °C (28/32 °F) in the winter months, and very cool in summer, when the maximum temperatures 
                        are similar to those of Cold Bay, around 12/13 °C (55/56 °F). Precipitation is frequent throughout the year, but especially in autumn. During winter, heavy 
                        snowfalls occur. In the mountain regions, we find glaciers and permanent snow. The Alaska Range reaches its peak in Mount McKinley, towering with its 6,194 
                        meters (20,321 feet). On the mountain slopes exposed to moist winds coming from the sea, every year large amounts of snow accumulate. Owing to both the facts
                        that snowfalls are heavy and summers are cool, the snowline is very low, and in some areas, the glaciers, which tend to slide slowly downward because of their 
                        weight, flow even into the sea.</p>
