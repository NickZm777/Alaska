                <p>Fairbanks is in the central Tanana Valley, straddling the Chena River near its confluence with the Tanana River. Immediately north of the city is a chain of 
                    hills that rises gradually until it reaches the White Mountains and the Yukon River. The city's southern border is the Tanana River. South of the river is 
                    the Tanana Flats, an area of marsh and bog that stretches for more than 100 miles (160 km) until it rises into the Alaska Range, which is visible from 
                    Fairbanks on clear days.[20] To the east and west are low valleys separated by ridges of hills up to 3,000 feet (910 m) above sea level.
                    The Tanana Valley is crossed by many low streams and rivers that flow into the Tanana River. In Fairbanks, the Chena River flows southwest until it empties 
                    into the Tanana. Noyes Slough, which heads and foots off the Chena River, creates Garden Island, a district connected to the rest of Fairbanks by bridges 
                    and culverted roads.
                    According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 32.7 square miles (85 km2); 31.9 square miles (83 km2) of it is land and 0.8 square miles 
                    (2.1 km2) of it (2.48%) is water. Fairbanks’ climate is classified as subarctic (Köppen Dfc close to Dwc),[24] with long cold winters and short warm summers. 
                    October through January are the snowiest months, and snow is limited from February to May. On average, the season's first snow falls on September 21, the first 
                    inch of snow accumulates by October 8 and the last inch of snow falls on April 27. The last flurries happen in April on average, but it occasionally does flurry 
                    in May. The snowpack is established by October 18, on average, and remains until April 23 Snow occasionally arrives early and in large amounts. On September 
                    13, 1992, 8 inches (20 cm) of snow fell in the city, bending trees still laden with fall leaves. That September was also one of the snowiest on record, as 24 
                    inches (61 cm) fell, compared to a median[26] of only 0.3 inches or 0.0076 metres during the month.[27] October and November are the snowiest months, whilst in 
                    contrast, March and April are not very snowy, as these are typically very dry months in central Alaska. The snowiest season has been from July 1990 to June 1991 
                    with 147.3 inches (3.74 m), whilst the least snowy was from July 1918 to June 1919 with only 12.0 inches (0.30 m).
                    The average first and last dates with a freezing temperature are September 9 and May 15, respectively, allowing a growing season of 116 days, although freezes 
                    have occurred in June, July, and August and the last light frost is often in early June and the first light fall frost is often in late August or early September.[2</p>
